This is to react basic.
Igniting the app.
1- npm is the biggest package manager.
2- npm init  - this creates package.json file where we have all necessary things or it just keeps the track of all dependencies.
3- when we do create react app web pack is used as bundler.We need to bundle our file when we want to put it in production.
4- but now as we r using npm we will use parser as bundler.
5 - npm install -D parcel
-> two type of dependency we can install one is dev depedency and there r normal dependency.
dev depedency - is used while dependency
normal - used in production or dev anywhere.
6 - "^2.8.3" this is ^ carrot this is to keep the dependency even there are minor updates.
Ex- 2.8.4 can be "^2.8.3" in package.json
7 - package.lock-json keeps exact track of version

8- parcel can have its own dependecies this is called transitive dependency, that's why we got so many dependencies when we installed parcel.
9 - if u see the node module and see any package it will have its own package.json as it can have their own dependency.
10 - just like we have npm we npx
npm is installing
npx is for execution.
11 - npx parcel index.html will execute parcel.
12 - tell if this is not a browser script this is considered as a module.
#parcel

13- i have removed main from package.json as we give entry point when we do code.
